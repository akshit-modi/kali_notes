Vmware
-->Platform dependent
---->It is only for windows.

vbox
-->Platform independent.


sudo apt update
-->It will update repositories
# -->Root user
$ -->normal user


Convert normal user into root user.
-->If you use live then first configure password for root.
---->sudo passwd
---->Enter new UNIX password: kali
---->Retype new UNIX password: kali



->In android play store, you can say as repository server.  
->For linux 2 types reposotory server server.
->Repository server also responsible for updates.
-->rpm

---->fedora
---->opensource
-->debian
---->.eeb
---->ubuntu
---->kali
---->parrot

-->blackarch supports packman 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

smart-robo@smartrobo:~$
-->smart-robo username
-->@ to connect username and machine name
-->smartrobo machine name
-->: for cotinuty
-->~you are in home directory
-->$ normal user

commands
whoami
@kali
-->It gives you username.

uname
@Linux
-->it gives informatiob about OS/.

pwd
@/home/smartrobo
-->It gives you path.

ls
-->list all files and folder.
ls -l
-->long list.
-->show size, when it is created.
ls -a
-->list all (hidden + showable)

clear (ctrl + l)

mkdir abc
-->Create a directory
mkdir -p a/b/c/d
-->create directory inside directory

-->run as root.
-->If you want one action perform as a root then use sudo.

sudo passwd
-->It change password for root.



ls -l 

permission of the files and folders.
1. owner side
2. group side (LAN area)
3. public side 

r = read, w = write, x = execute
r=4, w=2, x=1 
d is a directory

-->If you create permission using root then normal user also comes under group side.
-->If normal user create pemission then both are owners

total 0 
-->size.


apt list
-->Show all packages in the system.

apt show nmap
-->It will give information about package and also gives dependencies.

apt install nmap
-->You need root access for this.

apt update
-->update repository

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 address running on the network.
1) logical address
-->connect with wifi or lan cable.
-->

2) physical address.
-->Your system address - MAC address.
--> When you purchase NIC card manufacture put the address on the NIC card.
-->NIC - Network Interface Card.
-->Mac - Media Access Control address.
-->MAC address capture by switch by the req ARP.
-->when you connect with network with NIC card, automatically 1 req generate namely ARP (address resource protocol).
-->ARP capture your MAC address.
-->MAC address is read only memory.

-->without ARP router don't provide you IP address.


-->Router only understand IP address.
-->switch only understand MAC address.
---->Switch contains cam table.
---->Content Addressable Memory - CAM

route
-->Give you gateway details.

arp -a
-->Show your router IP address.
---->Gateway/router provides you NAT service.




WireShark Demo: 
-->Wireshark used for packet capturing.
-->Apt install wireshark
---->It will already installed in all the security OS.


-->wireshark
---->For opening wireshark GUI.
---->click on any. 
---->Click on any it will give you any(all) NIC card details.
---->write arp for watching arp generate request.
------>When you connect any device then it will show generated ARP request.
------>sender MAC address 


IP address
Class A
--> 0-126   --> 1.255.255.255
-->Network ID - Host ID
-->Used by biggest organization.
Class B
--> 128-191 --> 1.1.255.255
-->Network ID - Host ID
-->Used by medium organization
Class C
--> 192-254 --> 1.1.1.255
-->Used by small organization.
Class D & E
-->Used by Isro, DRDO, NASA for research.

-->First IP of Host used for identify the network.
---->192.168.34.0 == idenify the network.
---->You can not give this IP to anyone.

-->Last IP used as a broadcast IP.
-->There is two types of broadcast.
1) Limited
-->If someone connected to same LAN area and internally want to broadcast a message to all the device connected to the LAN then he has to use 255.255.255.255
-->It is known as limited broadcast.
2) Direct
-->If someone from another LAN area want to broadcast to your LAN area then he has to use 201.20.30.255 (201.20.30 = Network)

NAT - Network Address Translation
PAT - Port Address Translation


NAT
-->Convert your private IP address into public, public to private.

OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnection
--> Top to bottom
7) Application layer
-->Start your browser
6) Presentation layer
-->Format - html, doc, PNG, jpg...
-->SSL certificate also works on this layer. 
5) Session layer 
4) Transport layer
--> UDP - TCP port number.
-->Flags used.
3) Network layer
2) Data link layer
-->Work on switch.
-->It use MAC address for identification.
1) Physical layer
-->Server accept your packet at first layer.





Flags Used in communication.
-->It provides reliability.

syn
-->Check server is communicate with me or not.
Ack
-->If server is communicate with you then send back ack.
FIN
-->Finish
-->If Fin flag finish, you can confirm that is communication.
-->No three way hand shaking.
-->Only check server communicate or not.
PSH
-->Push
-->Packet received sequentially.
-->If push flag used then second flag first received then first first flag received.
RST
-->Reset
-->If server is not communicate with you then send back RST.
URG
-->Urgent


There is 2 types of service address
1) Informal dynamic port number
-->Client work on dynamic port
2) Static port number
-->Server work on static port number.



-->There is two things in the packet.
1) IP header
2)

There is 2 types of information gaathering.
1) Active
-->CCollect information about employers.
2) Passove
-->Collect information about servers.



-->Facebook.com runs on domain server.
-->Facebook website works on host.

-->If you connect both server then you need NS server.


dnsdumpster.com
-->It finds out depth information of server.
-->Beta version always have vulneribbility.

-->Information gathering about basic like DNS, expiry date... is not illegal.
-->whois.net website. 


@CVE - Common Vulnerability Exploitation

g++ --version
-->To check compiler for c++ is avaliable or not.

-->Ftp server is for developer.
-->Upload and download the file, this is the weakness.
-->Http server is for client.


There are three tools for information gathering.
1) NMap
-->Information gathering tool.
apt install nmap

->nmap -sS 20.220.32.56
-->This is IDLE scan.
-->syn stealth scan.
-->Simple scan to check which ports are open and closed.

->nmap -sS -sV 20.220.32.56
-->Gives you version.

->nmap -sS -sV -p 80 20.220.32.56
->nmap -sS -sV -p 80,80,443 20.220.32.56
->nmap -sS -sV -O -p 80,80,443 20.220.32.56

2) recon-ng
-->apt install recon-ng

->recon-ng
--> use <module name>
-->use recon//domains-vulnerabilities/xssed
---->show options
---->set SOURCE <website>
---->set SOURCE vgecg.ac.in
------>show options
------>run

3) Harvester
-->git clone <url>

->theHarvestor --help
->theHarvester -d vgecg.ac.in -l 25 -b all
-> 

Ghost
-->git clone <url>
-->./install.sh

-->ghost
---->help
---->connect <IP> (here android mb. IP taken from sudan)
------>shell
------>screenshot /home/desktop

Using Ghost
-->First use shodan in browser and search for anything. Here we search for android debug.
-->It will give you some android phone IP where debugger mode/ developer mode is active.
-->Then use this IP in ghost and access shell of the android.
